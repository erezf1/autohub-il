## What Will Change When We Merge

### ⚠️ Files That Will BE AFFECTED (Code Changes)

#### 1. **src/pages/admin/AdminAuctionsList.tsx** (Minor)
- **Change**: Reordering of state variable declarations
- **Before**: `activeTab` declared before `searchTerm`
- **After**: `searchTerm` declared before `activeTab`
- **Impact**: ✅ Non-breaking, just code organization

#### 2. **src/pages/admin/AdminVehicleRequestsList.tsx** (Minor)
- **Change**: Reordering of state variable declarations (same as above)
- **Before**: `activeTab` before `searchTerm`
- **After**: `searchTerm` before `activeTab`
- **Impact**: ✅ Non-breaking, just code organization

#### 3. **src/pages/mobile/MyProfileScreen.tsx** (Minor)
- **Change**: Import statement formatting and reorganization
- **Changes**:
  - Quotes: Single quotes → Double quotes for consistency
  - New import added: `PageContainer` and `PageHeader` from "@/components/common"
  - Import reordering for better organization
- **Impact**: ✅ Non-breaking, just import organization

### ❌ Files That Will BE REMOVED (Our Heebo Changes)

⚠️ **ATTENTION**: When merging, the following will be REMOVED unless we handle it carefully:

1. **HEEBO_FONT_SETUP.md** - Documentation we created
2. **public/Heebo/** - All 9 Heebo font files
3. **src/index.css** - Our Heebo font-face definitions and utilities
4. **tailwind.config.ts** - Our fontFamily configuration

## Merge Strategy Recommendation

### Option 1: ✅ RECOMMENDED - Merge with Our Changes Preserved
```bash
git merge upstream/main --no-edit
# Then manually add back the Heebo changes
```

**Pros**: Gets all upstream code improvements + keeps our Heebo setup
**Cons**: Need to manually restore Heebo files

### Option 2: Merge and Lose Our Changes
```bash
git merge upstream/main --no-edit
```

**Pros**: Clean merge
**Cons**: ❌ Loses all Heebo font setup

### Option 3: Don't Merge Yet
Wait until upstream has Heebo integrated, then merge.

## Recommendation

**I recommend Option 1**: Do the merge to get the small code improvements, then re-apply the Heebo changes because:

1. The upstream changes are minor and non-breaking
2. Our Heebo setup is important and should be preserved
3. We can quickly restore the Heebo files
4. This keeps us in sync with upstream while maintaining our font system

## Next Steps

1. Run: `git merge upstream/main --no-edit`
2. Copy back the Heebo files from a backup (or re-run our font setup)
3. Commit the merge: `git add . && git commit -m "Merge upstream/main with Heebo font preservation"`

Would you like to proceed with this approach?
